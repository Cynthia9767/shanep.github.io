## Grading Policy

Grades will be posted in canvas and calculated with the percentages specified below. **Final grades
will not be rounded**. I offer plenty of Extra Credit Opportunities that you can take advantage of
to improve your final grade.

| Letter Grade | Percentage |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| A            | 94% < 100% |
| A-           | 90% < 94%  |
| B+           | 87% < 90%  |
| B            | 84% < 87%  |
| B-           | 80% < 84%  |
| C+           | 77% < 80%  |
| C            | 74% < 77%  |
| C-           | 70% < 74%  |
| D+           | 67% < 70%  |
| D            | 64% < 67%  |
| D-           | 60% < 64%  |
| F            | 0 < 60%    |

## Extra Credit Opportunities

Standing extra credit is always offered to allow students to bump their grade up if they are on a
grading boundary so please take advantage of any extra credit offered. Any extra credit given over
the semester can not exceed 2.5% of the total points offered. For example, the maximum number of
extra credit points that you can earn if the total points offered is 1000 would be 25.

- Typos and Bugs - If you find any typos or bugs in the course materials, you can click the "Edit
this page" link at the bottom of the page, make the corrections, and then issue a [pull
request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). If
I merge your changes back into my repository then I will give you 5 bonus points. I have
strategically placed several spelling and grammar errors for you to find so there are plenty of
opportunities to get the maximum number of points offered. So make sure and read everything with an
eagle ü¶Ö eye so you can rack up those points!

::: tip

Creating a pull request is important and is the core learning objective in the extra credit
process. No points will be awarded for any other method of submission. Some pages may include other
markdown pages so when you click the edit button if you don't see the content that you want to
correct look for an `<!--@include: ../path/to/file.md -->` directive which will have the path to the
file that needs to be updated :)

:::

- Use of AI technologies - If you are able to solve 100% of any assignment with AI, I will give you
extra credit if you submit your chat logs as proof that it was 100% AI generated.

## Homework Policy

Unless explicitly instructed otherwise students are expected to work on their own. All group work
will be **clearly** marked so there should be no confusion.  The [Kount Computer Learning
Center](https://www.boisestate.edu/coen-cs/currentstudents/success-tutoring) (CCP 241) is accessible
24/7 by proxy card to all students enrolled in CS courses. Machines in the Kount Computer Tutoring
Center have all the software you will need this semester.

::: danger

It is still plagiarism to claim work that was generated by
[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) or other AI tools as your own and you will be written up
for Academic dishonesty if you do not cite your usage of any AI tools.

## Attendance Policy

I follow the official [attendance
policy](https://www.boisestate.edu/registrar/registration/attendance-policy/) as defined by the
university. Please see the Late Work section for details on how to make up any missed work. Students
are responsible for all verbal announcements or updates given during class.

## Late Work Policy

All homework assignments can be submitted up to **2 days late with no penalty**.  After the 2 day
grace period no further submissions will be accepted unless prior arrangements have been made before
the original due date. No work or extra credit will be accepted after the **last day of course
instruction**, the semester has to end at some point so plan accordingly. Work submitted 1 second
late is treated the same as work submitted 1 day late. You can find the last day of course
instruction at the
[registrar](https://www.boisestate.edu/registrar/boise-state-academic-calendars/).

::: info

For classes taught in the first 5wk or 7wk session of the semester, the last day of course
instruction is **NOT** the same as a regular semester. Please consult the
[registrar](https://www.boisestate.edu/registrar/boise-state-academic-calendars/) for the last day
of course instruction for your specific class.

## Exam and Quiz Policy

All exams and quizzes must be taken within the time frame specified on canvas unless prior
arrangements have been made. Clearly we can‚Äôt have some students taking an exam AFTER the questions
(and possibly answers) have been released as it would give that student an unfair advantage.
Extensions will be granted on a case by case basis for situations that were outside of the students
control. Some exams or quizzes may require you to go to the testing center. It is the student's
responsibility to schedule their own appointment in a timely fashion.

## Class Interaction Policy

All class interaction assignments must be completed within the time frame specified on canvas or
**during the lecture** unless prior arrangements have been made. Assignments that are intended to be
interactive are only valuable when everyone is participating at the same time. It is not fair for a
student to expect their fellow classmates to respond or watch your submission that is late when
everyone else submitted on time. The secret code for the syllabus quiz is "green".

This applies (but is not limited to) to the following assignment types:

- Discussion posts
- Reflections (both written and video)
- Group meetings - both virtual and in person
- Status updates
- Any in class activities
- Any quizzes or exams that are done on paper

## Communication Policy

During the semester communication outside of the classroom will be through email, canvas, and office
hours as detailed below. Other methods such as [carrier
pigeon](https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/the-incredible-carrier-pigeons-of-the-first-world-war) üê¶ are
not supported at this time.

I get a lot of email and sometimes I miss messages, so if you don‚Äôt receive a response from me after
48hrs please check to make sure you are sending the email from BroncoMail and send a follow-up
email. You can also send an email directly in canvas if your emails are not going through. To help
facilitate quick communication please include the following information in all emails to myself or
the class TA/GA.

- First and Last name
- Student ID - I need this so I can look you up in the system.
- The class and section number that you are in for example CS123 - section 1

BroncoMail is the official communication channel through which all university business is
conducted. It is expected that you access and read university communications two or three times per
week. For more information see the University Policy on Student Email Communications (Policy
2280). Your instructor will not respond to any emails sent from personal accounts such as Gmail or
Yahoo.

Your instructor will make every effort to return emails within 24hrs Monday thru Friday between the
hours of 9:00am and 5:00pm (MST). Emails sent on Saturday, Sunday, or outside of the defined hours
will be returned within 24hrs on the following business day. Emails should be reserved for questions
that are not appropriate for a public forum such as grades or other personal issues.

## Office Hours Policy

For classes taught in the online or remote format office hours will be accessible on canvas by
appointment. For classes that are taught in the face to face format office hours will only be
available in person with times posted in Canvas. If you can not find the office hours appointment
link in canvas please email me ASAP as I sometimes forget to post them at the start of the semester.

## IT support Policy

Your instructor and teaching assistant can not provide IT support for your personal machine. If you
can not get your personal machine configured correctly you will need to come into the lab to
complete all assignments. All machines in the CS labs are supported by the departments IT staff and
are guaranteed to work.

## Time Commitment

According to Boise State University [policy
4080](https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/academic-affairs-faculty-administration/policy-title-credit-hours/),
a 1 credit course spread over 15 weeks should require roughly 3 hours of work per week divided over
both in-class interactions and homework.  Classes that are held in compressed time frames such as
summer or winter breaks still need to complete the same number of credit hours in order for the
class to count toward your degree. Thus, if you are taking this class in a compressed semester
please consult the table below to make sure you have time to complete all the assigned course
work. For example, as noted in the table below, taking two 3 credit courses in a 7 week semester is
equivalent to working a full time job.

For a compressed course it is **critical** that you don‚Äôt fall behind!  Compressed courses move fast
and missing 1 week of class is very hard if not impossible to recover from.

| Credits | Number of weeks | Total Hours | Hours of work per week |
| ------- | --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| 1       | 3               | 45 hrs      | 15 hrs                 |
| 1       | 5               | 45 hrs      | 9 hrs                  |
| 3       | 7               | 135 hrs     | 19 hrs                 |
| 3       | 15              | 135 hrs     | 9 hrs                  |
